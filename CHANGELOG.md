    - *Tamas Corruption Spire*: Monolith (200 HP) protected by an impervious Void Shield until both resonance pillars are harmonized.
  - Real-time Floating Combat Text (`DamageNumberSystem.ts`):
    - Pooled floating numbers rendering gold damage dealt, red damage taken, green healing received, and cyan deflection notices.
  - End-of-Level Evaluation & Retry:
    - Dynamic rank grading (Rank S for <90s, Rank A for <150s, Rank B otherwise) with clear time and enemy kill tally.
    - Instant retry overlay upon defeat (`R` key or `[ SPACE ]` to restart instantly without reloading).
